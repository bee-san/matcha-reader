// brightness and warmth; the window is either two clock times or sunset to sunrise at a chosen
// city. Opening the window turns the light on and closing it turns the light off and restores
// the daytime levels. Nothing happens between those two moments, so a manual change made during
// the night (or the day) stays until the next one. The rules are in NightSchedule.h; the position
// last acted on is kept in CrossPointState, so a window that opened or closed while the device
// slept or was off is caught up on the next boot.
